# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Customer Churn Prediction**, where the goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service. Predicting churn early helps businesses take action, improve retention, and boost revenue.

This is an **end-to-end Machine Learning project**, covering data preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison.
